# WARROOM

**Break it before your users do.**

WARROOM is a chaos engineering and resilience testing tool that allows developers, solo builders, and teams to simulate real system failures, observe their impact in real time, and understand how their application behaves under stress before it reaches production users.

## Why WARROOM Exists

Modern applications are increasingly built:

- by solo entrepreneurs shipping fast
- using AI-generated code
- with multiple external dependencies

In this environment, systems often work in ideal conditions but fail unpredictably under stress.

WARROOM is built to answer one critical question:

**What happens when something breaks?**

Instead of guessing, WARROOM lets you:

- simulate failure scenarios
- observe real impact on your system
- understand the blast radius instantly
- take action before users are affected

## Who This Is For

### Solo Builders and Founders

If you are building quickly and deploying frequently, WARROOM helps you validate that your system will not break under real-world conditions.

### Developers Using AI-Generated Code

AI tools can generate working code, but not always resilient systems. WARROOM helps ensure that your application behaves correctly when dependencies fail or degrade.

### Teams Preparing for Scale

Before increasing traffic or launching features, WARROOM allows you to stress test critical paths and identify weak points early.

## What WARROOM Does

WARROOM provides a full loop from failure simulation to action:

1. Simulate failures
2. Observe system behavior
3. Understand impact in plain English
4. Get actionable next steps

## Core Features

### Failure Simulation

Trigger real system-level failures in a controlled environment:

- Database outage (`DB Down`)
- Latency injection (`Latency Spike`)
- Traffic surge (`Request Flood`)

These are executed using container-level controls and network manipulation.

### Real-Time System Visibility

WARROOM continuously monitors the system during a drill and shows:

- service status (application and database)
- success rate and error count
- response latency (`p95`)
- time of first failure
- event timeline

All metrics are derived from real responses, not simulated values.

### MCP-Based Control Plane

WARROOM uses a control layer to execute and track system changes:

- container stop and restart
- latency injection via proxy
- load generation

This makes the system transparent and reproducible.

### Live Interpretation Layer

WARROOM translates system signals into human-readable insights.

Instead of raw logs or dashboards, it explains:

- what is happening
- why it is happening
- how it affects users

This makes it accessible even to non-expert users.

### Technical Verdict

After each drill, WARROOM provides a clear diagnostic view:

- what failed
- how severe the failure was
- supporting evidence (metrics and timeline)
- likely cause

### Action Plan for Recovery and Improvement

WARROOM generates a structured next-step plan:

- what to fix immediately
- what to improve next
- how to make the system more resilient

These steps are written in a way that can be directly used with AI tools or engineering workflows.

## Example Scenarios

### Database Outage

Simulate the database going offline and observe:

- checkout failures
- application degradation
- Full loss of functionality in critical flows

### Latency Injection

Introduce delay in database communication and observe:

- increased response time
- degraded user experience
- potential cascading failures

### Traffic Surge

Apply load to the system and observe:

- system saturation
- latency spikes
- failure thresholds

## How to Run

### Start the System

```bash
podman compose up --build
```

### Verify Services

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/checkout -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

### Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Run MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9100
```

### Open Frontend

```bash
python -m http.server 5500 --directory frontend
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5500 in your browser.

## Architecture Overview

- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Backend: FastAPI
- Control Plane: MCP server (Podman + Toxiproxy)
- Demo Application: Flask + Postgres
- Infrastructure: container-based environment

## What Makes WARROOM Different

WARROOM is not just a monitoring tool.

It combines:

- failure simulation
- real-time observability
- interpretation
- action planning

This creates a complete workflow from:

**failure -> understanding -> resolution**

## Future Direction

- deeper AI-assisted failure analysis
- automated resilience scoring
- integration with CI/CD pipelines
- support for additional failure types and environments

## Summary

WARROOM helps you answer:

- What breaks when my system is under stress?
- How quickly does it fail?
- What do I need to fix before users are impacted?

Instead of discovering failures in production, WARROOM lets you discover them safely and early.
